## 🗂 Project Structure & Branching Strategy

To maintain clean separation of concerns and modular development, this repository follows a **multi-branch architecture**, where each component of the system will be developed and maintained independently:

### 📌 Branches
| Branch Name         | Purpose                                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `main`              | Production-ready and stable code                          |
| `frontend`          | All web and mobile UI/UX related code                     |
| `backend`           | API servers, database schemas, and business logic         |
| `ml-models`         | AI/ML model training, evaluation, and deployment scripts  |
| `rtsp-intigration`  | Code for smart sensors, edge devices, and firmware        |
| `docs`              | Technical documentation, architecture, API specs, etc.    |

> ⚠️ Never commit directly to `main`. All changes should go through Pull Requests (PRs) from relevant component branches and must pass code review.
